# Lemonade Stand Swift App

This is my first *real* iPhone App made in Swift. 

## Release Notes

#### v1.0

Lemonade Stand version 1.0. This is a simple game where you try to sell as much lemonade as possible, thereby increasing your profits, without running out of money. 

Each day your number of customers is randomized, each with a random taste preference. If your lemonade has more lemons than ice, it's acidic. If it has less, it's diluted. If it has equal parts, it's balanced. Your daily profits are based on the lemonade concentration and each customer's taste preference. 

This build includes the main page, the store page, and all the game logic.
